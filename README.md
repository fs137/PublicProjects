# Colloidal Crystals Research

CSIM:  A simulation of spherical colloids near a largish cylinder, with Asakura-Oosawa depletion forces.
  This is essentially an offshoot from a simple prototype developed by Prof. Chris Rycroft.  
  I chose to work with a custom simulation for my research both for the flexibility afforded by doing so, 
  and because my c++ skills were somewhat rusty.

CylCalc: A set of python scripts that can be used to enumerate what crystal lattices one might expect to 
  emerge from CSIM.
